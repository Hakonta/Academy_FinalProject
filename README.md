#About

###So what's this about?

SQT is the lovechild of a couple of students who attended [Academy](https://www.academy.no)(summer of 2019). It was developed in a two week project for our finals. 
Prior to the three months we've spent learning coding during our time at Academy, most of us had none or almost no experience with coding. 

It's been a fun ride and we hope you like our little project! 

###Why SQT?

If you've ever tried to book an e-scooter before, you've most likely ran into to this problem: 
So many providers(and apps!), but you just want the scooter that's the closest to where you are at the moment. 
It'd be so much easier if you could have them all on the same map. Well, now you can!
